			<h2>How to Start Your Home Child Care Program</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Child care is an important part of every community. If you are 20 years or older, love working with children, and feel you are good with children, then opening a home based, family daycare may be the business for you. You can make a difference for families and children every day, working right from your own home! Below are some key steps to get your business off the ground.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<h6><strong>STEP ONE</strong></h6>
			<p>				
				The first step in starting your home daycare is to apply for your license. You can download the
				application, or call 800-282-6063 to have it mailed. There are several steps to the application
				process, including background checks for all those in the home, as well as medical exams. For a full
				list of application steps, download the application packet.
			</p>
			<h6><strong>STEP TWO</strong></h6>
			<p>
				After your application is processed, you will receive guidance from the OEC to help ensure your
				home is in compliance with all health and safety requirements. For more information on home
				inspections, call 1-800-282-6063.
			</p>
			<h6><strong>STEP THREE</strong></h6>
			<p>
				Develop your business concept, insurance needs, and business type. Take the time to consider how
				your business will operate. How much will you charge? Will you close for all holidays? What will your
				expenses be? What types of activities do you want to offer? Look at insurance requirements for
				running a business from your home, and consider your budget as well as the structure of your
				business. Dial 211 for insurance information.
			</p>
			<h6><strong>STEP FOUR</strong></h6>
			<p>
				Once you have your business figured out, and your license is issued, itâ€™s time to promote your new
				business! Spread the word with neighbors, friends, and on social media. In no time, your home will be
				filled with little ones ready to learn and play!
