			<h2>Choosing Child Care</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Check License Status</strong><br>
				Be sure to check and see if a child care provider is
				licensed before choosing them. You can search
				licensed child care providers across Connecticut
				at <strong>www.211childcare.org</strong> or by dialing <strong>211</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Make Priorities</strong><br>
				Choosing the right child care for your family starts
				 with determining your priorities. What is most
				 important to you? Location or hours? Small or
				 large? Does your child have special healthcare
				 needs? Write down your needs and priorities to
				 help think through what’s most important.
				</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Determine Schedule</strong><br>
				Consider timing: Are you looking for certain days,
				hours, or weekend time to be covered? Do you
				need temporary or permanent child care support?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Research</strong><br>
				Do your homework by looking up potential
				caregivers to learn more about how they operate,
				what other families are saying about them, and to
				get a feel for their approach. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Visit & Ask Questions</strong><br>
				Once you have selected a few potential child care
				options, visit the locations—and bring your child!
				Look around to see if you like the environment,
				and talk to teachers and care providers.
				Remember to stay involved and visit routinely
				even after you have made your selection and
				placed your child with a child care provider.

			<h2>Types of Child Care</h2>

				status when selecting your child care provider, as
				licensed providers are held to health and safety
				standards.

				children on a regular basis.

				schools, and before and after school programs to more
				than 12 children.

			<h2>Why a License is Important</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Training & Background Checks </strong><br>
				Licensed providers receive background checks and
				medical exams for all staff members and staff are trained
				in ﬁrst aid.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Safety Standards</strong><br>
				Licensed providers must meet standards for cleanliness,
				 freedom of hazards, and ﬁre safety.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Quality Care</strong><br>
				Licensed providers only care for a limited amount of
				children at one time, and all staff meet standards
				monitored by the OEC Licensing Division.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Careful Oversight</strong><br>
				Licensed providers agree to unscheduled health and
				safety inspections from state licensing staff.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Support System</strong><br>
				Concerned parents can ﬁle a complaint with OEC, who
				investigate the claim and ensure that health and safety
				standards are always upheld.
